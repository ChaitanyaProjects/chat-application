# 💬 Chat App (MERN + WebSockets)

A **real-time chat application** built with the **MERN stack** and **Socket.IO**.  
It supports **user authentication**, **real-time messaging**, and **media sharing**, making it feel like a modern chat platform.



## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted to go beyond basic CRUD apps and build something that **feels like a real product**.  
A chat application was the perfect choice because it challenged me in multiple areas:

- 🔐 **Authentication** – Implemented secure login & signup with JWT + bcrypt.  
- ⚡ **Real-time Communication** – Learned WebSockets with Socket.IO for instant messaging.  
- 🗄️ **Database & API Design** – Designed MongoDB collections and REST APIs with Express.  
- 🎨 **Frontend State Management** – Used React + Zustand to manage live chat states.  
- ☁️ **Cloud Storage** – Integrated Cloudinary for profile images and media sharing.  

This project gave me hands-on experience with **end-to-end full-stack development** and showed how to make different technologies work together seamlessly.

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 User Authentication – Register, login, and secure sessions.  
- 💭 1-to-1 Real-time Chat – Built with WebSockets (Socket.IO).  
- 🖼️ Image Sharing – Upload and send media via Cloudinary.  
- 🌙 Theme Support – Light/Dark mode toggle.  
- 🔔 Toast Notifications – For new messages and actions.
